    "Expressions are made up of the following components :-\n",
    "\n",
    "Values: These are constants or literals, such as numbers (e.g., 5, 3.14) or strings (e.g., \"Hello, World!\"), that have a fixed and known value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables: These are symbols that represent values that can vary. Variables can be assigned values and used within expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Operators: These are symbols or keywords that perform specific operations on values or variables. Examples of operators include arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /), comparison operators (>, <, ==), and logical operators (&&, ||).\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions: These are named blocks of code that perform a specific task. They can take input values, called arguments or parameters, and return a result. Functions can be used within expressions to perform complex computations."

    "\n",
    "Evaluation and Result: Expressions are evaluated to produce a value as their result. The result can be assigned to a variable, used as part of a larger expression, or passed as an argument to a function. On the other hand, statements do not have a value as a result. They are executed to perform an action or modify the program state.\n",

    "Completeness: Expressions can be considered as building blocks that can be used within statements or other expressions. They can be combined to form more complex expressions. On the other hand, statements are standalone units of execution that carry out a specific task or action.\n",
    "\n",
    "Usage: Expressions are commonly used when you need to compute a value or perform a calculation. They are often used in assignments, comparisons, or function calls. Statements, on the other hand, are used to control the flow of execution, define program structure, and perform actions such as assignments, branching, or looping."

    "In most programming languages, including Python, variable names need to follow certain rules and conventions. Here are the rules for variable names:\n",
    "\n",
    "Valid Characters: Variable names can consist of letters (both uppercase and lowercase), digits (0-9), and underscores (_). However, they cannot start with a digit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Starting Character: Variable names must start with a letter (a-z, A-Z) or an underscore (_). They cannot begin with a digit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Case Sensitivity: Most programming languages are case-sensitive, so variable names like \"eggs\" and \"Eggs\" are considered distinct and refer to different variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on these rules, \"eggs\" is a valid variable name because it starts with a letter and consists only of valid characters (letters). It follows the conventions for variable naming.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, \"100\" is an invalid variable name because it starts with a digit instead of a letter or underscore. Following the rules, variables cannot begin with a digit.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's worth noting that some programming languages have specific additional rules or restrictions for variable names. Therefore, it's always a good practice to consult the documentation or guidelines of the specific programming language you are using."

    "The expression 'I have eaten' + 99 + 'burritos.' causes an error because it attempts to concatenate a string ('I have eaten') with an integer (99) without proper conversion or formatting.\n",

    "python Copy code result = 'I have eaten ' + str(99) + ' burritos.' print(result) # Output: \"I have eaten 99 burritos.\" By using str(99), we convert the integer 99 to its string representation, allowing it to be concatenated with the surrounding strings.\n",
